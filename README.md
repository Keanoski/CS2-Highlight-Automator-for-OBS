# 🎥 CS2 Highlight Automator for OBS

A C# tool that automates the extraction and recording of highlight moments from CS2 demo files using **OBS Studio** via [`obs-websocket`](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket). It detects kill streaks (5+ kills), launches CS2 for playback, and coordinates OBS to record cinematic highlight reels.
